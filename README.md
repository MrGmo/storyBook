# storyBook

Hi there!

This repo contains a storybook app that allows its users to log in using google auth and write their own stories they can share with other people on the platform. Once logged in the user can write, update, or delete his own stories. They are also allowed to read stories other users have posted as long as the owner has set that specific story to public.

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Handlebars, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Google Auth

This was one of my bigger projects at the time of building it so keeping all the files organized was one of my biggest challenges. I also started learning handlebars because I thought it would be a good idea to learn as many templates as possible since Javascript is so versatile. I think the organization of this project is pretty good, but could still be more in-line with the MVC architecture. At the time this order made the most sense to me so I just went with it.

Optimizations:

I need to improve my CSS skills a bit more because all my projects are functional, but don't look as sharp as I would like them to. If I had more time I would have included some bootsrap color classes or at least a bit more CSS styling.

Lessons Learned:

  1. I learned how to use handlebars as a template.
  2. I reinforced my understanding of mongoose shema's.
  3. I learned how to organize bigger projects with multiple routes. 
  4. I improved my understanding of middleware and learned to use google auth as a login method.
